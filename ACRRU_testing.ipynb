      "Summary: Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) demonstrates a high level of executive engagement and leadership in addressing climate resilience, aligning with Level 3 criteria of the Climate Resilience Maturity Model. ComEd's CEO, Gil Quiniones, has been actively involved in leading and advocating for climate resilience initiatives. The company has undertaken a comprehensive Climate Risk and Adaptation Study in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on the power grid, including risks such as sustained heat and flooding. The initiative is a part of ComEd's broader strategy to ensure the grid's resilience and reliability amidst changing climate conditions. This level of executive involvement and the strategic approach to climate resilience planning and action, including the engagement of a risk committee and the briefing of climate risks and actions to the CEO and Board of Directors, exemplifies the governance structure and leadership commitment required at Level 3 of the CRMM.\n",

      "Summary: While ComEd's initiatives and leadership engagement primarily align with Level 3, evidence also supports their positioning at Level 2. The company's proactive approach in identifying primary physical climate risks and generating resilience and/or process adaptation options is evident through their partnership with Argonne National Laboratory for a Climate Risk and Adaptation Study. This study not only identifies risks but also collaborates with climate scientists, risk analysts, and power systems engineers to ensure the grid's readiness for future challenges. This collaborative effort and the strategic planning involved indicate a structured approach to addressing climate resilience, fulfilling the criteria for Level 2 of the CRMM.\n",

      "Summary: Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) has initiated the process of integrating physical climate risks into its planning processes. This is evidenced by its collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory to conduct a comprehensive Climate Risk and Adaptation Study. The study aims to examine the impact of changing weather due to climate change, including sustained heat and flooding risk, on the design and performance of the power grid in the region. This initiative represents a foundational step towards incorporating climate considerations into ComEd's grid planning efforts, indicating the beginning of a structured approach to climate-aware planning.\n",

      "Summary: Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) has demonstrated active collaboration with city and state government bodies on climate resilience through its engagement in the development and revision of grid plans under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). This act mandates significant investments in the state's climate goals, including the transition away from greenhouse gas-emitting energy generation. ComEd's efforts to align its grid plans with CEJA, despite facing regulatory challenges, indicate a commitment to working with government entities to enhance climate resilience. Additionally, ComEd's partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory on a Climate Risk and Adaptation Study further exemplifies its collaboration with governmental bodies to address climate change impacts on the power grid.\n",

      "Summary: ComEd's engagement with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) and its response to regulatory feedback on its grid plans underlines its active collaboration with the proximate Public Utility Commission on climate resilience. The utility has been involved in a dynamic regulatory process, submitting and revising its grid plans to align with the state's climate and equity goals as outlined in CEJA. This process demonstrates ComEd's commitment to working closely with the ICC to address climate resilience in its operations. Furthermore, ComEd's collaboration with credit rating agencies, as evidenced by its credit ratings and outlooks, reflects its engagement with insurance and credit ratings firms, although the direct link to climate resilience through these interactions is less explicit.\n",

      "Summary: Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) has initiated efforts to understand and address the impacts of climate change on its power grid, which indirectly involves community engagement through the study of climate risks and adaptation. This includes launching comprehensive studies in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory to examine the changing weather's impact on the power grid's design and performance. While these efforts are primarily focused on grid resilience, they reflect an initial step towards engaging with the broader community by considering the climate change impacts on the regions they serve. However, direct evidence of \"town hall\" style community briefings specifically aimed at gathering community concerns and priorities related to climate resilience is not provided.\n",

      "Summary: There is no direct evidence that ComEd conducts recurring meetings specifically with commercial and industrial customers to discuss climate resilience. While ComEd has launched studies to understand the technical and community challenges presented by the clean energy transition, these efforts seem to be more focused on grid resilience and adaptation rather than direct engagement with commercial and industrial customers or prioritizing economically challenged communities in resilience measures.\n",

      "Summary: ComEd's engagement in climate resilience planning does not provide direct evidence of regular interface sessions with government bodies across various levels or the incorporation of feedback from customer engagements into planning and prioritization processes. While ComEd's initiatives, such as the partnership with Argonne National Laboratory for a Climate Risk and Adaptation Study, indicate a structured approach to understanding climate impacts, there is no specific evidence of active engagement with economically challenged communities in resilience planning or the existence of regular meetings with government entities specifically for climate resilience.\n",

      "Summary: Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) demonstrates a high level of executive engagement and leadership in addressing climate resilience, aligning with Level 3 criteria of the Climate Resilience Maturity Model. ComEd's CEO, Gil Quiniones, has been actively involved in leading and advocating for climate resilience initiatives. The company has undertaken a comprehensive Climate Risk and Adaptation Study in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on the power grid, including risks such as sustained heat and flooding. The initiative is a part of ComEd's broader strategy to ensure the grid's resilience and reliability amidst changing climate conditions. This level of executive involvement and the strategic approach to climate resilience planning and action, including the engagement of a risk committee and the briefing of climate risks and actions to the CEO and Board of Directors, exemplifies the governance structure and leadership commitment required at Level 3 of the CRMM.\n",
