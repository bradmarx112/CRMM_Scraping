Capability 5 explanation: 
Prioritization based on consequences of inaction invariably produces winners and losers. Some interests will benefit from resilience investments, others will suffer especially when cost-benefit analyses produce decisions that include triage of certain assets which will affect local communities and businesses. It is therefore essential that customers and communities have a voice in the process so that resilience investment decisions are made with them, not just about them.
