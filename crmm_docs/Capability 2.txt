Capability 2: Climate-Aware Planning

	Level 3:
	* Recurring discussions are held with interdependent entities to monitor their climate resilience plans and policies.  
	* Planned asset resilience actions are weighted by considering the impact if current or assets to-be-build were lost.  
	* Climate resilience considerations inform a wide variety of enterprise planning processes, including long-term infrastructure, financial, maintenance, operational, restoration, business continuity, etc.
	* Supply chain is being monitored from a climate risk perspective
	Level 2:
	* Climate resilience lead has an active role in all significant planning processes 
	* An investigation has begun to understand significant physical climate risks to key product or services providers.
	Level 1:
	* Entity has begun assessing how and where to include physical climate risks in its planning processes
	Level 0:
	* Ad hoc / no discernable process  


Capability 2 explanation:
Many organizations think of resilience as something thatâ€™s demonstrated in the response, recovery and rebuilding actions taken after a damaging or disruptive event. In fact, after action reports very often point to a lack of planning and preparation as one of the primary causal factors heightening the degree of damage experienced.  These reports most often recommend improvements in planning and preparations be implemented as soon as possible.
