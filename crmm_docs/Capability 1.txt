Capability 1 explanation:
Organizations can rarely act effectively on any critical task if they haven’t allocated resources and built structures to affect those actions. In short, those that do identify and empower employees, including senior decision makers, to internally advocate for climate resilience policies, plans and actions will be better positioned to meet the challenges of extreme weather and other climate change-exacerbated risks than those that don’t. These appointments also serve as important cultural signals that tend to foster company-wide awareness and alignment.
