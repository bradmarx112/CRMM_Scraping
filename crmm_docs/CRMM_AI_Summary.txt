The Climate Resilience Maturity Model (CRMM) is designed to assess and guide essential services providers in enhancing their resilience to climate-related challenges. The model focuses on utilities responsible for critical infrastructures like electricity, natural gas, communications, transportation, and water and wastewater services.

Resilience is defined as the ability to prepare for, adapt to, and recover rapidly from changing conditions and disruptions, including deliberate attacks, accidents, or natural threats. Various stakeholders, such as insurance companies, credit ratings firms, regulators, emergency planners, property developers, and essential service providers, have a vested interest in understanding the preparedness of utilities for climate impacts.

The CRMM employs maturity levels to evaluate organizational capabilities in addressing challenges related to reliable operations amidst a changing climate. The maturity levels range from "No discernable process" (Level 0) to "Mature - process management includes deliberate process optimization/improvement" (Level 3). The model aims to help utilities progress towards higher maturity levels, serving as a guide and source of comparative data for those interested in assessing climate resilience in specific cities and areas.
