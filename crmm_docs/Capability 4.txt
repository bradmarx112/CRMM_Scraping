Capability 4: Resilience and Adaptation Actions

	3
	* Initial hardening and/or adaptation actions have been implemented and more are in the planning stage
	* Tabletop exercises are conducted against projected worst-case climate projections with and without prioritized resilience and adaptation measures in place 
	* Cost-benefit / resilience-efficacy analyses of resilience and adaptations are being or have been reviewed by 3rd party Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)[8]
	* In an extreme heat event context, especially for government, but often with support of essential services providers, public health measures like well-provisioned cooling centers and additional hospital preparedness measures indicate a higher level of maturity
	2
	* Vulnerability assessment results inform plans for resilience and adaption measures
	* Entity has studied the measures other organizations in the same sector and roughly the same region have taken to improve their resilience postures.
	1
	* Initial climate vulnerability assessments on key assets are underway or have concluded

	* Ad hoc / no discernable process  
 
 
Capability 4 explanation:
Planning the right way is one thing. Acting on those plans with time to spare is quite another. So itâ€™s best not to sit long on the insights an organization gets from climate models. From cost benefit analysis, to design, permitting, financing and more, hardening and/or relocating the assets that support critical functions is the works of years.
