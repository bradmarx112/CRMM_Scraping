### Level 3: Executive Climate Resilience Lead; Briefings to CEO and Board; Integration in Policies and Plans

- **Evidence**: While there is evidence of Pepco's active engagement in climate resilience through initiatives like the Climate READi and the submission of climate-focused plans to regulatory bodies, there is no direct evidence available in the provided sources that explicitly mentions the appointment of an executive climate resilience lead, nor the frequency of briefings to the CEO and Board of Directors. Similarly, there is no explicit mention of the integration of climate risks into integrated resource plans (IRPs) or other policies with sign-off or input from a risk committee.

**Conclusion**: Based on the available evidence, Potomac Electric Power Co (Pepco) demonstrates activities and initiatives that align with Levels 1 and 2 of the Climate Resilience Maturity Model under the capability of Governance – Executive Level Engagement and Leadership. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively place Pepco at Level 3, as specific details regarding executive-level engagement, leadership roles, and the integration of climate resilience into high-level decision-making processes are not explicitly documented in the sources reviewed."
