core set of principles that inform our decision-making. | \\u200bAdditional Resources | \\u200b | Environmental Policy (https://azure-na-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt71bfe6e8a1c2d265/bltc320e2642a070852/Exelon_Environment_Policy_Poster-8.5x11v2.pdf) | (pdf)\\n |  Climate Leadership  | Examine our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. | Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our time, and demands that we actively pursue every opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a member of the voluntary EPA SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems Program, we’re proactively working to prevent SF6 leaks on our equipment. | We have created an industry-leading green supply chain network. | We’re building one of the country’s largest alternative-fuel and energy-efficient hybrid vehicle fleet. | We’ve developed industry-leading energy efficiency programs. | We’re recycling office materials as well as industrial materials—which reduces what is sent to landfills in addition to reducing our carbon footprint. |  Resource Conservation  | See how we are managing materials and properties more efficiently | We’re recycling tons of materials in the office and in the field—reducing our carbon footprint, cutting the amount of waste going into landfills. | Project HERE | (Helping the Environment by Recycling at Exelon) increased recycling more than 5% over the previous year. The more than 1.9 million pounds of recycled material includes paper, cardboard, plastic and glass containers, and aluminum cans. | Industrial Recycling | incorporates recycling of copper, aluminum, steel, transformers and oil. More than 15 million pounds of metals and more than half a million gallons of oil were recycled yearly. These two programs offset thousands of tons of carbon emissions. We continue to build on their combined success while also actively searching for ways to green our supply chain. | In 2008, our parent company, Exelon, led the formation of the Electric Utility Industry Sustainable Supply Chain Alliance, along with 14 other electric utilities. The Alliance works to improve environmental performance in electric utility industry supply chains. This includes the development of voluntary consensus standards for evaluating the environmental attributes of key materials and services provided to the electric utility industry; the environmental performance of suppliers to the electric utility industry; and the environmental performance of an electric utility industry company’s supply chain operations. | Exelon was also the first U.S. based utility to join the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration. As part of our commitment, Exelon is asking top suppliers to voluntarily disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. |  Environmental Management System  | Our EMS assigns roles and responsibilities at each level of our organization. | To execute this policy, we have established an environmental management program or system (EMS) that assigns roles and responsibilities at each level of our organization. The EMS is an integral part of the Exelon Management Model, the framework for the way we do business. | Our EMS received ISO 14001 Certification in November 2008. ISO 14001 Certification is the globally recognized “gold” standard for promoting effective, systematic management of environmental risks and liabilities. ISO 14001 contributes to our goal of implementing an EMS and strengthens our position as an industry environmental leader. | Our EMS is a continual cycle of planning, implementing, reviewing and improving the processes and actions that we undertake to meet our business and environmental goals. Built on the \"Plan, Do, Check, Act\" model, our EMS enables BGE to take the following actions: | systematically manage our environmental risks and liabilities | improve environmental performance by clarifying environmental accountabilities, roles, and responsibilities and develop consistent environmental programs across the business | integrate environmental concerns and performance improvements into business decision-making and planning | improve business performance as environmental costs are better managed, planned for, and reduced over time | increase credibility and strengthen relationships with external stakeholders. | Through ongoing support of our EMS program and execution of our environmental policy, our stakeholders can expect to see continued improvement in Exelon’s environmental performance. | \\u200bAdditional Resources | \\u200b | ISO Certification (https://azure-na-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt71bfe6e8a1c2d265/blta29997dd6cfe3a82/BGE_ISO_Certificate.pdf) | (pdf) |  Accountability  | BGE has been monitoring environmental performance and taking actions to ensure conservation since before 1970. | BGE has been monitoring environmental performance and taking actions to ensure conservation since before 1970. As part of our commitment, BGE continues to work to preserve and improve the quality of the environment. |  Helping Customers Conserve  | BGE encourages our customers to conserve energy and make energy efficient choices. Visit | www.bgesmartenergy.com (http://www.bgesmartenergy.com/) | for more information. |  Safeguarding Our Natural Resources  | A core element of our company\\'s commitment to the environment is protecting the wildlife, forests, plants and waterways in our communities. | BGE has adopted a comprehensive avian protection plan to reduce bird mortalities from electrocution.

      " |  Climate Leadership  | Examine our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. | Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our time, and demands that we actively pursue every opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a member of the voluntary EPA SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems Program, we’re proactively working to prevent SF6 leaks on our equipment. | We have created an industry-leading green supply chain network. | We’re building one of the country’s largest alternative-fuel and energy-efficient hybrid vehicle fleet. | We’ve developed industry-leading energy efficiency programs. | We’re recycling office materials as well as industrial materials—which reduces what is sent to landfills in addition to reducing our carbon footprint. |  Resource Conservation  | See how we are managing materials and properties more efficiently | We’re recycling tons of materials in the office and in the field—reducing our carbon footprint, cutting the amount of waste going into landfills. | Project HERE |  (Helping the Environment by Recycling at Exelon) increased recycling more than 5% over the previous year. The more than 1.9 million pounds of recycled material includes paper, cardboard, plastic and glass containers, and aluminum cans. | Industrial Recycling |  incorporates recycling of copper, aluminum, steel, transformers and oil. More than 15 million pounds of metals and more than half a million gallons of oil were recycled yearly. These two programs offset thousands of tons of carbon emissions. We continue to build on their combined success while also actively searching for ways to green our supply chain. | In 2008, our parent company, Exelon, led the formation of the Electric Utility Industry Sustainable Supply Chain Alliance, along with 14 other electric utilities. The Alliance works to improve environmental performance in electric utility industry supply chains. This includes the development of voluntary consensus standards for evaluating the environmental attributes of key materials and services provided to the electric utility industry; the environmental performance of suppliers to the electric utility industry; and the environmental performance of an electric utility industry company’s supply chain operations. | Exelon was also the first U.S. based utility to join the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration. As part of our commitment, Exelon is asking top suppliers to voluntarily disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. |  Environmental Management System  | Our EMS assigns roles and responsibilities at each level of our organization. | To execute this policy, we have established an environmental management program or system (EMS) that assigns roles and responsibilities at each level of our organization. The EMS is an integral part of the Exelon Management Model, the framework for the way we do business. | Our EMS received ISO 14001 Certification in November 2008. ISO 14001 Certification is the globally recognized “gold” standard for promoting effective, systematic management of environmental risks and liabilities. ISO 14001 contributes to our goal of implementing an EMS and strengthens our position as an industry environmental leader. |  Our EMS is a continual cycle of planning, implementing, reviewing and improving the processes and actions that we undertake to meet our business and environmental goals. Built on the \"Plan, Do, Check, Act\" model, our EMS enables BGE to take the following actions: | systematically manage our environmental risks and liabilities | improve environmental performance by clarifying environmental accountabilities, roles, and responsibilities and develop consistent environmental programs across the business | integrate environmental concerns and performance improvements into business decision-making and planning | improve business performance as environmental costs are better managed, planned for, and reduced over time | increase credibility and strengthen relationships with external stakeholders. | Through ongoing support of our EMS program and execution of our environmental policy, our stakeholders can expect to see continued improvement in Exelon’s environmental performance. | ​Additional Resources | ​ | ISO Certification (https://azure-na-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt71bfe6e8a1c2d265/blta29997dd6cfe3a82/BGE_ISO_Certificate.pdf) |  (pdf) |  Accountability  | BGE has been monitoring environmental performance and taking actions to ensure conservation since before 1970. | BGE has been monitoring environmental performance and taking actions to ensure conservation since before 1970. As part of our commitment, BGE continues to work to preserve and improve the quality of the environment. |  Helping Customers Conserve  | BGE encourages our customers to conserve energy and make energy efficient choices. Visit  | www.bgesmartenergy.com (http://www.bgesmartenergy.com/) |  for more information. |  Safeguarding Our Natural Resources  | A core element of our company's commitment to the environment is protecting the wildlife, forests, plants and waterways in our communities. | BGE has adopted a comprehensive avian protection plan to reduce bird mortalities from electrocution. This plan includes establishing new distribution line construction standards, removing or relocating nests, providing employee training on avian management and establishing bird perch deterrents. |  Beautifying and Preserving Our Communities  | BGE was awarded with a Greenscape Award while supporting \"green\" initiatives in the city of Annapolis. The beautification and commitment to helping our local communities always encompasses safeguarding natural resources. |  Electricity Facts (Supply Mix)  | The following environmental information is for BGE customers with Standard Offer Service, which is provided to those customers who have remained with BGE and who have not chosen a competitive electricity supplier. | Power plants can generate electricity from a number of different fuel sources, resulting in different emissions.

      "assistant: Based on the Climate Risk Maturity Model and the provided HTML text from Baltimore Gas and Electric, here's an assessment of how the information might inform the capabilities within the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 1: Governance – Executive Level Engagement and Leadership\n",
      "The HTML text outlines Baltimore Gas and Electric's commitment to the environment, which implies an organized effort to address climate-related issues. The multi-year plan, combined with executive actions such as the establishment of environmental policies, suggests a level of governance and executive engagement. However, specific details regarding a risk committee, executive climate resilience leads, or direct CEO and Board briefings on physical climate mission risks could not be identified from the provided text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: Partial information, implying some level of executive engagement but lacking specifics on governance structure relative to climate resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 2: Climate-Aware Planning\n",
      "The commitment to environmental stewardship and specific initiatives like recycling and alternative fuel vehicle fleets indicate an awareness of climate-related planning. The mention of contributing to reducing carbon footprint and several initiatives aimed at environmental conservation demonstrates planning that considers climate resilience. However, details on the integration of climate resilience in enterprise planning processes specifically were not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: Evidence of climate-aware actions, though not detailed in the context of comprehensive planning processes as outlined in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 3: Stakeholder and Community Collaboration\n",
      "Baltimore Gas and Electric's text mentions community engagement and initiatives to protect local wildlife and environment, indicating an effort towards stakeholder and community collaboration. However, details on active collaborations with Infrastructure Sharing and Analysis Centers, insurance and credit ratings firms, trade groups, and chambers of commerce are not mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: Evidence of community engagement but lacks specifics on collaboration with wider stakeholder groups listed in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 4: Resilience and Adaptation Actions\n",
      "The initiatives regarding environmental conservation, recycling, and commitment to reducing the carbon footprint suggest proactive steps toward resilience and adaptation. Efforts to build one of the country’s largest alternative-fuel and energy-efficient hybrid vehicle fleets also reflect adaptation actions. However, specific tabletop exercises, vulnerability assessments, or third-party reviews as mentioned in the model are not detailed in the provided text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: Activities aligned with resilience and adaptation are mentioned, but not in the specific context of maturity levels identified in the model (e.g., detailed planning stages, vulnerability assessments).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 5: Customer Engagement and Coordination\n",
      "BGE encourages customers to conserve energy and offers resources for energy-efficient choices, indicating customer engagement. The reference to community involvement and assistance programs further supports this capability. However, regular interface sessions with government bodies or detailed engagement strategies with customers are not elaborately detailed in the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: Indications of customer engagement through various programs and resources, lacking details on systematic engagement as per maturity levels defined in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Capability 6: Attention to Equity\n",
      "The text does not provide detailed information directly related to the active engagement of economically challenged communities in resilience and adaptation planning processes or prioritization in the allocation of resilience measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**: No information specifically related to the engagement and prioritization of economically challenged communities in resilience planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the HTML text from Baltimore Gas and Electric suggests awareness and some actions towards climate resilience, detailed information aligning directly with the specific capabilities and maturity levels in the Climate Risk Maturity Model is limited. Further information or detailed documentation from the company would be necessary to fully assess its maturity level across the six capabilities.\n",
